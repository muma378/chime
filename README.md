# chime
Chime is inspired by Ansible. It is an open-source project aims to provide a distributed platform to execute programes instead of running locally, or remotely with a lot of trivia.
It makes use of the infrastructure of Ansible to connnect to remote, transfer data or command, and execute. We will make effort on building a C\S structure to deliver tasks and data.
